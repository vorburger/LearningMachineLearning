# Learning Machine Learning (ML)

This is a git repository started by [Michael Vorburger.ch](http://www.vorburger.ch) to learn Machine Learning (ML), similar to [my other learning repos](https://github.com/vorburger?tab=repositories&q=Learning&type=&language=&sort=).

## Usage

1. https://colab.research.google.com/github/vorburger/LearningMachineLearning/blob/develop/beginner.ipynb
1. The same in Python code instead of a Notebook, and with training and inference split:
   1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   1. `./beginner-train.py` produces `beginner.model/`
   1. `./beginner-infer.py` uses `beginner.model/`

[ToDo.md](ToDo.md) has stuff to do.
