1. Use `Interpreter`

1. https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/serving/rest_simple

1. Try to hand-draw a digit on 28x28 pixels, and load that image file and have it recognized!

1. Use model in https://www.tensorflow.org/js and
   hack a Web App with a 28x28 pixels Canvas to draw on!

1. TF lite instead of full TF in `beginner-infer.py`
   AFTER https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/58264 is fixed
   (or after I can self build lite on a machine with more memory)

1. Run the model with TF lite on the Coral board, using fixed image; then perhaps with the webcam?

1. `WARNING:tensorflow:No training configuration found in save file, so the model was *not* compiled. Compile it manually.`

1. _LOW PRIORITIY: Write `Dockerfile` to run that .py in a container (using https://www.tensorflow.org/install ?)_
