# Keyword Spotter

Originally from https://github.com/google-coral/project-keyword-spotter,
but forked by me with minor changes:

    git clone git@github.com:vorburger/project-keyword-spotter.git
    cd project-keyword-spotter
    git checkout vorburger
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ./run_model.py

But this doesn't actually work - the model is specific to Edge TPU on Coral.
